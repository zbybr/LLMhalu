Generate 5 synonyms of the answer based on the context of the question and return a numbered list to me. 
Make sure the generated synonyms are meaningful sentences. 
Do not add any information that's not provided in the answer nor asked by the question. Just return the list.
For example:
Question: What is the most popular sport in Japan?
Answer: Baseball is the most popular sport in Japan.
Mutations:
1. Japan holds baseball as its most widely embraced sport.
2. The sport with the highest popularity in Japan is baseball.
3. Baseball reigns as Japan's most favored sport among the populace.
Notice how the full context is included in each generated synonym.
If you generated just 'baseball,' it would not make a meaningful sentence.
Just return the numbered list. Do not add anything before or after the list.
"""

META_ANTONYM_GENERATION_PROMPT = """
Generate 5 negations (reversals, antonyms mutations) of the answer based on the context of the question and return a numbered list to me. 
Make sure the generated antonyms are meaningful sentences. 
Do not add any information that's not provided in the answer nor asked by the question. Just return the list.
For example:
Question: What is the most popular sport in Japan?
Answer: Baseball is the most popular sport in Japan.
Mutations:
1. The most popular sport in Japan is not baseball.
2. Baseball is not the most popular sport in Japan.
3. Japan does not consider baseball as the most popular sport.
Be careful about double negations which make the sentence semantically same to the provided one. The context of the question 
is really important. Notice how the antonyms are meaningful sentences in the example. You should negate the meaning of the sentence based on the question.
Just return the numbered list. Do not add anything before or after the list.
"""

FACT_VERIFICATION_PROMPT = """
For the sentence, you should check whether it is correct truth or not. Answer YES or NO. If you are 
NOT SURE, answer NOT SURE. Don't return anything else except YES, NO, or NOT SURE.
